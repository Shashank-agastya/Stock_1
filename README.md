# üìà StockTrack Analytics: Stock Market Forecasting Dashboard

A dynamic, interactive Streamlit dashboard designed to analyze historical stock data, forecast future prices using ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models, and provide actionable insights for financial analysis.

---

## üéØ Short Description / Purpose

The **StockTrack Analytics Dashboard** is a powerful tool for investors and financial analysts to predict stock prices. It fetches historical stock data, applies advanced time series forecasting models, and presents results through interactive charts and a comprehensive report, enabling data-driven investment decisions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

This dashboard leverages the following technologies:

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and model implementation.
- **yfinance**: Library for fetching historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the interactive web-based dashboard.
- **Plotly**: Library for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Statsmodels**: Implements ARIMA and SARIMA models for time series forecasting.
- **Prophet**: Facebook‚Äôs time series forecasting library for robust predictions.
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the LSTM neural network.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides utilities for data preprocessing and metrics calculation.
- **ngrok**: Enables public URL access for running the dashboard in Google Colab.

## üìä Data Source

The dashboard utilizes data from:

- **Yahoo Finance (via yfinance)**: Historical stock data including closing prices and volume for any valid stock ticker (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple).

### Data Fields

- **Close Price**: Primary metric for forecasting.
- **Volume**: Analyzed for technical indicators.
- **Date Range**: User-selectable (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, or max).

> üíæ Data is fetched in real-time using the yfinance library and processed within the Streamlit app.

## üåü Features / Highlights

### Business Problem

Stock price forecasting is challenging due to market volatility and the need for accurate, centralized analysis tools.

### Goal of the Dashboard

To provide a single, interactive dashboard that fetches historical stock data, trains multiple forecasting models, evaluates their performance, and visualizes predictions for informed investment decisions.

### Key Visuals

- **Historical Stock Prices**: Displays closing prices over the selected period.
- **Forecast Plots**: Overlays predictions from ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models.
- **Model Performance**: Bar chart comparing Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) across models.
- **Forecast Comparison**: Line chart showing predicted price trends for each model.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Stationarity test results (ADF) and seasonal decomposition (if applicable).

### Business Impact & Insights

- **Accurate Forecasting**: Combines multiple models for robust stock price predictions.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compares model accuracy using MAPE and RMSE metrics.
- **Interactive Analysis**: Allows customization of stock symbols, periods, and forecast horizons.
- **Decision Support**: Provides insights into price trends, volatility, and volume for investment planning.
